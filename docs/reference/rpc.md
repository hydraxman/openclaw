# RPC adapters

OpenClaw integrates external CLIs via JSON-RPC. Two patterns are used today.

## Pattern A: HTTP daemon (signal-cli)

- `signal-cli` runs as a daemon with JSON-RPC over HTTP.
- Event stream is SSE (`/api/v1/events`).
- Health probe: `/api/v1/check`.
- OpenClaw owns lifecycle when `channels.signal.autoStart=true`.

See [Signal](/channels/signal) for setup and endpoints.

## Adapter guidelines

- Gateway owns the process (start/stop tied to provider lifecycle).
- Keep RPC clients resilient: timeouts, restart on exit.
- Prefer stable IDs (e.g., `chat_id`) over display strings.
